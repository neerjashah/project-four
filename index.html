          <!--p><p id="aboutpolarpara">The largest bear in the world and the Arctic's top predator, polar bears are a powerful symbol of the strength and endurance of the Arctic. The polar bear's Latin name, Ursus maritimus, means "sea bear." It's an apt name for this majestic species, which spends much of its life in, around, or on the ocean–predominantly on the sea ice. In the United States, Alaska is home to two polar bear subpopulations.
  
            Considered talented swimmers, polar bears can sustain a pace of six miles per hour by paddling with their front paws and holding their hind legs flat like a rudder. They have a thick layer of body fat and a water-repellent coat that insulates them from the cold air and water.
            
            Polar bears spend over 50% of their time hunting for food. A polar bear might catch only one or two out of 10 seals it hunts, depending on the time of year and other variables. Their diet mainly consists of ringed and bearded seals because they need large amounts of fat to survive.

            Many scientists believe that due to climate change and resulting environmental factors, the trend is reversing. The Department of the Interior’s classification has more to do with increasing concerns for the future than with current population numbers. The Endangered Species Act of 1973 defines a "threatened" species as one "which is likely to become an endangered species within the foreseeable future throughout all or a significant portion of its range."

                    still found in roughly their original habitat and range--and in

                    the world's 19 populations have returned to healthy numbers,
                    there are differences between them. Some are stable, some seem

                Ministers and other leaders from the five polar bear range
                states met in Moscow for the first International Forum on Polar
                Bear Conservation. The leaders made significant commitments to
                address issues of polar bear habitat, research and trade. This
                event was supported by WWF.

                Today, polar bears are among the few large carnivores that are
                still found in roughly their original habitat and range--and in
                some places, in roughly their natural numbers. Although most of
                the world's 19 populations have returned to healthy numbers,
                there are differences between them. Some are stable, some seem
                to be increasing, and some are decreasing due to various
                pressures. Status of the polar bear populations Updated 2019
